# Encologim

Hi 
  I m developping this tools set in order to create an easy updatable software developement method,
 I aim to stay in the middle of dynamic object generation and free user hand design, the road is long 
 and the objectives are many, that's my way of thinking may be you are agree or desagree so I m open 
 to any suggestion and remark, until now I m alone on this project that I started for my personal reasons
 where the main is that is one of my dreams

any contribution is welcome
